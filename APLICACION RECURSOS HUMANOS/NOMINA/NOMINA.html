=head1 PLUGINS

C<App::Prove> provides support for 3rd-party plugins.  These are currently
loaded at run-time, I<after> arguments have been parsed (so you can not
change the way arguments are processed, sorry), typically with the
C<< -PI<plugin> >> switch, eg:

  prove -PMyPlugin

This will search for a module named C<App::Prove::Plugin::MyPlugin>, or failing
that, C<MyPlugin>.  If the plugin can't be found, C<prove> will complain & exit.

You can pass an argument to your plugin by appending an C<=> after the plugin
name, eg C<-PMyPlugin=foo>.  You can pass multiple arguments using commas:

  prove -PMyPlugin=foo,bar,baz

These are passed in to your plugin's C<load()> class method (if it has one),
along with a reference to the C<App::Prove> object that is invoking your plugin:

  sub load {
      my ($class, $p) = @_;

      my @args = @{ $p->{args} };
